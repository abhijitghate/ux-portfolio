		<h2>Why Redesign TuneIn &#128251; ?</h2>

		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="cs-image" src="images/Meet_Maria.png" alt="why redesign tunein?" style=max-width:80%;>
			<figcaption>Figure: Why Redesign TuneIn ?</figcaption>
		</div>
        <!--
		<p>Meet Maria! Maria finds herself getting distracted by video content, a major chunk of it on YouTube, 
		for hours at length.</p>

		<p>Maria is handed a Radio: Eureka!</p>
			
		<p>She realises that audio content happens to be consumable while being engaged- cooking, driving or even working! This 
		understanding initiates her resolution to be more productive and consume content in audio formats 
		henceforth. In her journey towards transitioning from consuming entertainment in the form of video 
		to audio, she lands herself on the <a href="https://tunein.com/">TuneIn website</a> more than a dozen times, 
		only to find herself never committing to its web browser application.</p> -->
			
		<p>On some investigation, Maria and her friend learn that TuneIn aims to be the largest 
		annotated catalog of live radio programming and on-demand radio <b style="color: #000000;">(more than 100,000 radio stations 
		and 4 million podcasts)</b> from around the world with 
		more than <b style="color: #000000;">75 million monthly active users</b> as of 2019. TuneIn works on multiple platforms like voice assistants, 
		home sound systems, multiroom entertainment platforms, Google Play Store, App Store, Microsoft Store, is even
		integrated with various car models, etc.</p>
			
		<p>Despite TuneIn's extensive database of diverse content, Maria identifies it's web browser application to be 
		noticably apathetic yet the most accessible interfaces to her. Since I was looking to do a redesign piece for my portfolio,
		Maria asks me to try redesigning it to be more empathetic to its users. And so begins the journey of the redesign of 
		TuneIn's web browser application.</p>

		<h2>UX Roadmap</h2>

		<p>In order to identify the pain points and subsequent opportunities for redesign, an
		iterative design process that comprised of the following UX activities
		were carried out within a self-imposed period of a month.</p>

		<div class="full-width">

		<h3>Research</h3>
		<h4>Competitive audit</h4>

		<p>TuneIn's business goal is steered to streaming live radio from world over on the internet on one dial
		and further solving for discovery.</p>
			
		<p>Since music streaming and the new "radio" that are automated playlists are impacting the market share for
		Live Radio, it makes it all the more crucial to observe and analyse the competitor music streaming services as well.</p>

		<p>Popular competitors to TuneIn as listed by web analytics service,<a class="inline-links" href="https://www.similarweb.com/">
		SimilarWeb</a> and as per <a class="inline-links" href="https://xconomy.com/national/2013/01/11/turning-on-to-live-internet-radio-with-tunein/?single_page=true">
		an interview of the current CEO of TuneIn, John Dunham by Wade Roush, a podcast producer</a>
		are iHeartRadio, Sirius XM, Pandora, Deezer (which are not available in India) and <a class="inline-links" href="https://www.stitcher.com/">Stitcher</a>,
		<a class="inline-links" href="https://www.spotify.com/in/">Spotify</a>, <a class="inline-links" href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> 
		and <a class="inline-links" href="https://radio.garden/listen/therunnner-radio/SDoYxqkH">Radio Garden</a> among others.</p>

		<p>Out of these, the applications chosen for the audit were based on :
			<ol type="1">
				<li>Whether or not they aim to cater to a global user base.</li>
				<li>Similarity of the products they offered to TuneIn.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="cs-image" src="images/feature-matrix.png" alt="feature matrix" style="max-width:85%;">
			<figcaption>Figure: Feature matrix</figcaption>			  
		</div>

		<h4>User Research</h4>

		<p>The user base that I convened comprised of :	
			<ol type="1">
				<li>Obviously! Maria.</li>
				<li>Friends who use / are familiar with TuneIn or it's competitor applications.</li>
				<li>Traditional radio users who were open to the idea of engaging with a radio application on a PC.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<p>Five individuals from the aforementioned user base participated
		in an exercise to compare the competing applications across a matrix of
		usability and satisfaction. They were given time to familiarise themselves with the applications
		and then asked to plot each of the applications on the graph as seen below.</p>

		<div class="full-width">
			<img src="images/usability-satisfaction matrix.png" alt="usability-satisfaction matrix" style="max-width:85%;">
			<figcaption>Figure: Usability-Satisfaction matrix.<i>Shown here is the plotted mean for the 5 sample users.</i></figcaption>
		</div>	
	
		<p>Although Spotify is higher up in its overall performance mainly attributed
		to its "recommender system" and its aesthetics, users claim it isn't the most efficient
		of applications owing to it's incoherent sections under the Browse panel. Stitcher is at par in
		it's usability due to its "Less is more" approach in content organisation. Radio Garden with
		it's unique and minimalistic approach to presenting Live Radio remains highly usable lagging behind
		in its aesthetic element. The most outstanding thing about SoundCloud is the importance
		the application gives to user engagement via its socialisation features. iHeart Radio which is the
		closest in function to TuneIn scores well in it's overall performance as it makes a large
		amount of unique content convenient for discovery and is ahead of TuneIn in terms of usability and engagement.</p>

		<p>Further interviews comprised of the users discussing their real/ hypothetic motivations to use the App, how they
		would go about the usage and what their pain points are. We looked at a page-wise critique of the application
		generally comprising of its homepage, category page and the final product page.</p>

		<p>I also referred to user reviews from TuneIn's Facebook page and a forum called Anime Superhero which
		incidentally had a thread on TuneIn.</p>

		<p>The pain points as pointed out by the users verbatim :</p>

	    <h4>Heuristic Walkthroughs with potential and existing users</h4>

		<p>The personas and research have helped us narrow down to 3 representative goals that our users may want to achieve.
		The tasks involved in achieving the goals shall be evaluated against
		the widely accepted 
		<a class="inline-links" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Jakob Nielson's heuristics.</a></p>
				
		<p>Once the violations to these heuristics are identified,
		they will be given a severity rating.
			<ul type=none>
				<li>0 — don’t agree that this is a usability problem</li>
				<li>1 — cosmetic problem</li>
				<li>2 — minor usability problem</li>
				<li>3 — major usability problem; important to fix</li>
				<li>4 — usability catastrophe; imperative to fix</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="cs-image" src="images/heuristic walkthroughs.png" alt="heuristic-walkthroughs" style="max-width:85%;">

		</div>
				
		<h3>Making sense of it all a.k.a. Problem Definition</h3>

		<p>This round of formative research helps in identification of
			complications primarily in Navigation, Search and Discovery.</p>

		<h4>Information Architecture</h4>

		
		<blockquote cite="https://tunein.com/">
			Live Sports.<br>
			Music.<br>
			News.<br>
			Podcasts.
			</blockquote>

		<h4>Taxonomy and Semantics</h4>

		<h4>card Sort</h4>
		<p>The taxonomy is aligned with its business goals, hence credible.
		However, certain flows do indicate missing/ erroneous tags which
		will need to be flagged and raised with the data collection and
		developer teams if this were a real-time project.</p>

		<p>Global Semantics used on the page work well. However,
		semantics used on regional categories are not on par and
		carry the scope of another project utilising extensive regional
		resources in itself.</p>

		<h4>*“Is this live radio?”*: Redesigning Navigation, Search and Discovery</h4>

		<p>The Key Insights derived from potential users indicated ineffective
		communication of a unique value proposition for users in the Homepage.
		The Navigation menus also contributed to confusion in the spectrum of
		products offered by the application.</p>
		<p>As a result, there is a requirement to clarify that the 2 types of products
		offered are Live Radio and On-Demand Radio (otherwise known as Podcasts)
		and support that with a USP in the Info page during on-boarding.</p>

		<p>For the sake of Search and Discovery however, the products have been
		divided into 4 categories based on their attributes:
			<ol>
				<li>Live Radio: Name, Production, Currently playing</li>
				<li>Podcasts: Name, Production</li>
				<li>Events: Name, Description, Station, Date, Timing</li>
				<li>Shows: Name, Station</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
				
		<p>Each kind of product offered is further categorised based on various
		user-friendly categories and also the genre of content.</p>

		<p>The overall scope of this redesign is thus mostly confined to the features
		that come under the gamut of Navigation, Search and Discovery.</p>

		<h4>Feature Prioritisation</h4>

		<p>What this activity attempts to do is prioritise features based on
		desirability and feasibility in terms of technical overhaul and time
		or viability in terms of business goals.</p>

		<img src="" alt="feature prioritisation matrix" style="width: 42px; height: 42px; border: 0;">

		<h3>Churning out the design</h3>

		<h4>User Scenarios</h4>

		<p>User scenarios have been designed to incorporate
		exploratory and explicatory user-flows of a first-time user to
		share the on-boarding flow and that of a seasoned user going about
		advanced functionalities respectively to capture the span of possible
		scenarios.</p>

		<p>1. Maria who has been looking for new ways to entertain herself is
					 recommended to listen to Podcasts on TuneIn by a friend.(socail media aspect)</p>

				![ handrawn wireframes- user flow-1](link"2X2FeaturePrioritisationMatrix")

		<p>2. Shyam tries to find an item within his favourites section.</p>
