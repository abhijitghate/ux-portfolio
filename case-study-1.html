		<h2 class="zero-margin-bott">Why Redesign TuneIn &#128251; ?</h2>
		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="cartoon" src="images/Meet-Maria.png" alt="why redesign tunein?" style=max-width:80%;>
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">• Why Redesign TuneIn? •</figcaption>	
		<p class="text">On some investigation, Maria and her friend learn that TuneIn aims to be the largest 
		annotated catalog of live radio programming and on-demand radio <b class="bold">(more than 100,000 radio stations 
		and 4 million podcasts)</b> from around the world with 
		more than <b class="bold">75 million monthly active users</b> as of 2019. TuneIn works on multiple platforms like voice assistants, 
		home sound systems, multiroom entertainment platforms, Android, iOS, Windows, is even
		integrated with various car models, etc.</p>	
		<p class="text">Despite TuneIn's extensive database of diverse content, Maria identifies it's web browser application to be 
		noticably apathetic yet the most accessible interfaces to her. Since I was looking to do a redesign piece for my portfolio,
		Maria asks me to try redesigning it to be more empathetic to its users. And so begins the journey of the redesign of 
		TuneIn's web browser application.</p>



		<h2 class="heading-two">UX Roadmap</h2>
		<p class="text">In order to identify the pain points and subsequent opportunities for redesign, an
		iterative design process that comprised of the following UX activities
		were to be carried out within a self-imposed period of a month.</p>
		<div class="full-width">

		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">• UX Roadmap •</figcaption>


		
		<h3 class="heading-three">Research</h3>



		<h4 class="heading-four">Competitive audit</h4>
		<p class="text">TuneIn's business goal is steered to streaming live radio from world over on the internet on one dial
		and further solving for discovery.</p>			
		<p class="text">Since music streaming and the new "radio" (automated playlists) are impacting the market share for
		Live Radio, it makes it all the more crucial to observe and analyse the competitor music streaming services as well.</p>
		<p class="text">Popular competitors to TuneIn as listed by web analytics service,<a class="inline-links" href="https://www.similarweb.com/">
		SimilarWeb</a> and as per <a class="inline-links" href="https://xconomy.com/national/2013/01/11/turning-on-to-live-internet-radio-with-tunein/?single_page=true">
		an interview of the CEO of TuneIn, John Dunham by Wade Roush, a podcast producer</a>
		are iHeartRadio, Sirius XM, Pandora, Deezer (which are not available in India) and <a class="inline-links" href="https://www.stitcher.com/">Stitcher</a>,
		<a class="inline-links" href="https://www.spotify.com/in/">Spotify</a>, <a class="inline-links" href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> 
		and <a class="inline-links" href="https://radio.garden/listen/therunnner-radio/SDoYxqkH">Radio Garden</a> among others.</p>
		<p class="text">Out of these, the applications chosen for the audit were based on :</p>
		<ol class="num-list" type="1">
			<li class="list-item">Whether or not they aim to cater to a global user base.</li>
			<li class="list-item">Similarity of the products they offered to TuneIn.</li>
		</ol>
		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="cs-image" src="images/feature-matrix.png" alt="feature matrix" style="max-width:75%;">			  
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">• Competitive audit using a feature matrix •</figcaption>



		<h4 class="heading-four">User Interviews</h4>
		<p class="text">The user base that I convened comprised of :</p>	
		<ol class="num-list" type="1">
			<li class="list-item">Obviously! Maria.</li>
			<li class="list-item">Friends who use / are familiar with TuneIn or it's competitor applications.</li>
			<li class="list-item">Traditional radio users who were open to the idea of engaging with a radio application on a PC.</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="text">Five individuals from the aforementioned user base participated
		in an exercise to compare the competing applications across a matrix of
		usability and satisfaction. They were given time to familiarise themselves with the applications
		and then asked to plot each of the applications on the graph as seen below.</p>
		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="cs-image" src="images/usability-satisfaction matrix.png" alt="usability-satisfaction matrix" style="max-width:65%;">
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit"><i>• Shown here is the plotted mean for 5 sample users on a usability-satisfaction matrix. •</i></figcaption>	
		<p class="text">The interview also comprised of the users discussing their real/ hypothetic motivations to use the App, how they
		would go about the usage and what their pain points are. We looked at a page-wise critique of the application
		generally comprising of its homepage, category page and the final product page.</p>
		<p class="text">I also referred to user reviews from TuneIn's Facebook page and a forum called Anime Superhero which
		incidentally had a thread on TuneIn.</p>

		<h4 class="heading-four">Heuristic Walkthroughs with potential and existing users</h4>
		<p class="text">The user needs described above have been coalesced into 3 specific scenarios to undertake heuristic walkthroughs.

		<a class="inline-links" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Jakob Nielson's heuristics.</a></p>

		<h3 class="heading-three">Making sense of it all a.k.a. Problem Definition</h3>



		<h4 class="heading-four">"Is this Live Radio?"</h4>
		<p class="text">The formative research on TuneIn exposed the tough competition that Radio faces from other
			types of content in video and written formats on the internet. Hence, introducing potential users like Maria
			to "Live Radio" and "Podcasts" to navigate audio content also becomes an important function.  
		</p>
		<p class="text">For example, the homepage adorns the tagline below leading to a bad usability experience for "Exhaustive seekers" 
			like Maria.</p>
		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="cs-image" src="screenshots/is this.png" alt="tagline" style="max-width:55%;">

		<figcaption class="fig-tit">• TuneIn's Tagline •</figcaption>
		<p class="text">Inspite of it's Unique Value Proposition being its vast catalog of Live and On-Demand Audio content,

			<li class="list-item-ia"><h5 class="heading-five">1. Taxonomy</h5><p class="text">By shifting from its present system of organisation that appears to be a restrictive hierarchichal taxonomy,

		<h3 class="heading-three">Ideation, User Testing and Iteration</h3>



		<h4 class="heading-four">Concept Sketches</h4>
		<p class="text">As a Proof of Concept, I prioritised these use cases to be redesigned in the TuneIn experience
		to follow <a class="inline-links" href="#user-scenarios">the 4 Types of User Scenarios</a>
		discussed earlier in the process.</p>

		Iterations to the flow and its UI elements were carried out by conducting user tests using Lo-Fi wireframes.
		
		cognitive walkthroughs
		contextual task analysis
		usability testing- creating, conducting
		card sorting

		A unmoderated usability test was conducted with 5 of our users as prescribed sufficient by <a></a>. The test 
		resulted in the users expecting certain types of content to appear in a different navigation menu as expected.
		Hence a card sort exercise was conducted with our users before the prototype for the exercise was finalised. 




		Certain considerations maintained in the redesign were as follows:
		It was necessary to keep ads above the fold to adhere to it's business model.

		<h3 class="heading-three">Takeaways</h3>	
		<ul>
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold-miriam">Live Radio under Threat:</b> Although several news articles released on the likes of the "World Radio Day" may 
				argue otherwise, Radio as a medium is under threat and can only survive amongst the youth via the internet.
				Hence, studying the real world context surrounding it give us an insight into such an 
				application's larger role to play. In this case, educating people about the jargon around radio, 
				identifying its utility for specific events such a local/ natioanl disasters and 
				designing to incorporate an affordance can play a role in preserving it's relevance.
			</li>
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold-miriam">The Experience of Search and Discovery:</b> Although building algorithms is 
				rightfully the developer's role, designers informed and involved with pertinent 
				Search and Information Retrieval (IR) algorithms will prove a godsend to any team. According to my research, 
				features such as real-time content suggestions on Searching and IR based on weighted properties such as 
				the occurence of an item being favourited, the number of streams, 
				the date and location seemed appropriate for retrieval.
			</li>
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold-miriam">At crossroads? Look to your user! :</b> Every time I am swept away by the influence 
				user/stakeholder interactions have towards design resolution. These contributions must never be overlooked. 
				That said, the opportunity to organise and conduct a successful Charrette would be a dream.
			</li>
