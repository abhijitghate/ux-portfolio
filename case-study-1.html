	<h1>TUNEIN WEB APPLICATION REDESIGN</h1>
<!--	A self-directed UX redesign project  -->

		<h2>Why Redesign TuneIn :radio:?</h2>

		<img src="" alt="why redesign tunein?" style="width: 42px; height: 42px; border: 0;">

		<h2>Process</h2>

		<p>In order to identify the pain points and subsequent opportunities for redesign an
			iterative design process that comprised of the following [activities](ux activities on GitHub)
			was planned to be carried out within a self-imposed period of a month.</p>

			<h3>Competitive audit</h3>
			<p>TuneIn's business goal is steered to promote streaming live radio on the internet
				and bringing all of radio from world over on one dial and further solving for discovery.
				Several music streaming websites are being considered competitors to TuneIn since music
				streaming and the new "radio" which are automated playlists have impacted the market for
				Live Radio making it all the more crucial to observe and analyse those services as well.</p>

			<p>Popular competitors to TuneIn as listed by web analytics service, SimilarWeb and as per
				<a href="https://xconomy.com/national/2013/01/11/turning-on-to-live-internet-radio-with-tunein/?single_page=true">
				an interview of the current CEO of TuneIn, John Dunham by Wade Roush, a podcast producer</a>
				are iHeartRadio, Sirius XM, Pandora, Deezer- none of which are available in India and <a href="">Stitcher</a>,
				<a href="">Spotify</a>, <a href="">SoundCloud</a>, <a href="">Radio Garden</a> among others.</p>

			<p>Out of them, the applications selected for the audit were based on:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Whether or not they aim to cater to a global user base</li>
				<li>The products they offered</li>
			</ol>

      <img src="" alt="Feature matrix" style="width: 42px; height: 42px; border: 0;">

			<h3>User Research</h3>

			<p>The user base that I convened were:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Maria</li>
				<li>Friends via social media who are familiar with TuneIn.</li>
				<li>Traditional radio users who were open to the idea of engaging with a radio application on a PC.</li>
				<li>Users that use TuneIn or other apps to listen to live radio.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>I also referred user reviews from TuneIn's Facebook page and a forum called Anime Superhero which
				incidentally had a thread on TuneIn.</p>

			<p>Five users who were familiar or were ready to engage with the selected apps were selected to conduct
				a comparative audit. The audit involved plotting the competing applications across a matrix of
				usability and satisfaction with TuneIn.</p>

				![Image of the matrix](link"Usability-SatisfactionMatrix")--

			<p>We see that although Spotify is higher up in its overall performance which is mainly attributed
				to its "recommender systems" and its aesthetics although users claim it isn't the most efficient
				of applications owing to it's incoherent sections under the Browse panel. Stitcher is at par in
				it's usability owing to its "Less is more" approach in organising it's content. Radio Garden with
				it's unique and minimalistic approach to presenting Live Radio remains highly usable lagging behind
				majorly in its aesthetic element. The most outstanding thing about SoundCloud is the importance
				the application gives user engagement via its socialisation features. iHeart Radio which is the
				most close in function to TuneIn scores well in it's overall performance as it makes a large
				amount of unique content convenient for discovery and is also ahead of TuneIn in terms of related
				functionalities.</p>

			<p>Further interviews comprised of the users discussing their real/ hypothetic motivations to use the App, how they
				would go about the usage and what their pain points are. We looked at a page-wise critique of the application
				generally comprising of its homepage, category page and the final product page.</p>

			<p>The pain points as pointed out by the users verbatim:</p>

				##### HOMEPAGE
				> *“I don’t use the homepage ever.”*

				> *“Is this live radio?”*

				> *"I don't see the Value Proposition."*

				> *"But LISTEN to what NOW??""*

				##### NAVIGATION
				> *"The navigation bar is confusing me."*

				> *"It feels pretty easy to use at first."*

				##### SEARCH
				> *“Where's the search bar?”*

				##### BROWSE
				> *“Browsing for stations is very difficult and the listicles presented aren't great either.”*

				##### FAVOURITES
				> *“Organising the favourites section is not intuitive.”*

				> *“I wish I could customize my page and playlists more.”*

				> *"Cannot favourite certain episodes from podcasts."*

				##### PRODUCT PAGE
				> *"How do I go back to my search results from this station?"*

				##### ERROR RECOGNITION
				> *"It's neither running with Firefox nor Chrome on Ubuntu. There is some error and I can't fix it."
				#### Unveiling of our User Personas

				#### Heuristic Walkthroughs with potential and existing users

				Since we are focusing only on the redesign of its web browser application, we shall restrict hypothesising Maria and Shyam engaging with it to indoors i.e., at home, at a work/ co-working place or in certain public spaces as informed by the user research. The personas and research enabled identification of various goals that a user may want to achieve. The tasks involved in achieving the goals shall be evaluated against one among the widely accepted set of heuristics.

				Jakob Nielson's heuristics:
				1. Visibility of system status
				2. Match between system and the real world
				3. User control and freedom
				4. Consistency and standards
				5. Error prevention
				6. Recognition rather than recall
				7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
				8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
				9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
				10. Help and documentation

				Once the violations to these heuristics are identified, they will be given a severity rating.

				0 — don’t agree that this is a usability problem
				1 — cosmetic problem
				2 — minor usability problem
				3 — major usability problem; important to fix
				4 — usability catastrophe; imperative to fix

				### 2. Making sense of it all a.k.a. Problem Definition

				#### Information Architecture

				This round of formative research helps in identification of complications primarily in Navigation, Search and Discovery.

				##### Taxonomy and Semantics

				### card Sort
				The taxonomy is aligned with its business goals, hence credible. However, certain flows do indicate missing/ erroneous tags which will need to be flagged and raised with the data collection and developer teams if this were a real-time project.

				Global Semantics used on the page work well. However, semantics used on regional categories are not on par and carry the scope of another project utilising extensive regional resources in itself.

				##### *“Is this live radio?”*: Redesigning Navigation, Search and Discovery

				The Key Insights derived from potential users indicated ineffective communication of a unique value proposition for users in the Homepage. The Navigation menus also contributed to confusion in the spectrum of products offered by the application.
				As a result, there is a requirement to clarify that the 2 types of products offered are Live Radio and On-Demand Radio (otherwise known as Podcasts) and support that with a USP in the Info page during on-boarding.

				For the sake of Search and Discovery however, the products have been divided into 4 categories based on their attributes:
				1. Live Radio: Name, Production, Currently playing
				2. Podcasts: Name, Production
				3. Events: Name, Description, Station, Date, Timing
				4. Shows: Name, Station

				Each kind of product offered is further categorised based on various user-friendly categories and also the genre of content.

				The overall scope of this redesign is thus mostly confined to the features that come under the gamut of Navigation, Search and Discovery.

				#### Feature Prioritisation

				What this activity attempts to do is prioritise features based on desirability and feasibility in terms of technical overhaul and time or viability in terms of business goals.

				1. Customised Homepage instead of a standardised Homepage
				2. Taxonomy
				3. Navigation tab
				3. Search within certain categories- favourites, language, location
				4. Social Plugins- Like, Plays, Share, Comment
				5. Recommender system
				6. Organising the favourites sections
				7. Favouriting episodes from shows/Podcasts
				8. To previous pages- breadcrumbs??
				9. Error diagnosis
				11. Users as content curators
				12. Profile Page and Feed
				13. Notifications for newly released episodes from stations you have favorited
				14. An interactive introduction of key app features during the onboarding flow may also be helpful for new users.
				15. An efficient layout
				16. Revising input controls

				### 3. Churning out the design

				#### User Scenarios

				User scenarios have been designed to incorporate  exploratory and explicatory user-flows of a first-time user to share the on-boarding flow and that of a seasoned user going about advanced functionalities respectively to capture the span of possible scenarios.

				1. Maria who has been looking for new ways to entertain herself is recommended to listen to Podcasts on TuneIn by a friend.(socail media aspect)

				2. Shyam tries to find an item within his favourites section.
