		<h2 class="zero-margin-bott">Why Redesign TuneIn &#128251; ?</h2>
		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="cartoon" src="images/Meet-Maria.png" alt="why redesign tunein?" style=max-width:80%;>
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">• Why Redesign TuneIn? •</figcaption>	
		<p class="text">On some investigation, Maria and her friend learn that TuneIn aims to be the largest 
		annotated catalog of live radio programming and on-demand radio <b class="bold">(more than 100,000 radio stations 
		and 4 million podcasts)</b> from around the world with 
		more than <b class="bold">75 million monthly active users</b> as of 2019. TuneIn works on multiple platforms like voice assistants, 
		home sound systems, multiroom entertainment platforms, Android, iOS, Windows, is even
		integrated with various car models, etc.</p>	
		<p class="text">Despite TuneIn's extensive database of diverse content, Maria identifies it's web browser application to be 
		noticably apathetic yet the most accessible interfaces to her. Since I was looking to do a redesign piece for my portfolio,
		Maria asks me to try redesigning it to be more empathetic to its users. And so begins the journey of the redesign of 
		TuneIn's web browser application.</p>



		<h2 class="heading-two">UX Roadmap</h2>
		<p class="text">In order to identify the pain points and subsequent opportunities for redesign, an
		iterative design process that comprised of the following UX activities
		were to be carried out within a self-imposed period of a month.</p>

		<h3 class="heading-three">Research</h3>



		<h4 class="heading-four">Competitive audit</h4>
		<p class="text">TuneIn's business goal is steered to streaming live radio from world over on the internet on one dial
		and further solving for discovery.</p>			
		<p class="text">Since music streaming and the new "radio" (automated playlists) are impacting the market share for
		Live Radio, it makes it all the more crucial to observe and analyse the competitor music streaming services as well.</p>
		<p class="text">Popular competitors to TuneIn as listed by web analytics service,<a class="inline-links" href="https://www.similarweb.com/">
		SimilarWeb</a> and as per <a class="inline-links" href="https://xconomy.com/national/2013/01/11/turning-on-to-live-internet-radio-with-tunein/?single_page=true">
		an interview of the CEO of TuneIn, John Dunham by Wade Roush, a podcast producer</a>
		are iHeartRadio, Sirius XM, Pandora, Deezer (which are not available in India) and <a class="inline-links" href="https://www.stitcher.com/">Stitcher</a>,
		<a class="inline-links" href="https://www.spotify.com/in/">Spotify</a>, <a class="inline-links" href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> 
		and <a class="inline-links" href="https://radio.garden/listen/therunnner-radio/SDoYxqkH">Radio Garden</a> among others.</p>
		<p class="text">Out of these, the applications chosen for the audit were based on :</p>
		<ol class="num-list" type="1">
			<li class="list-item">Whether or not they aim to cater to a global user base.</li>
			<li class="list-item">Similarity of the products they offered to TuneIn.</li>

		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">• Competitive audit using a feature matrix •</figcaption>



		<h4 class="heading-four">User Interviews</h4>
		<p class="text">The user base that I convened comprised of :</p>	
		<ol class="num-list" type="1">
			<li class="list-item">Obviously! Maria.</li>
			<li class="list-item">Friends who use / are familiar with TuneIn or it's competitor applications.</li>
			<li class="list-item">Traditional radio users who were open to the idea of engaging with a radio application on a PC.</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="text">Five individuals from the aforementioned user base participated
		in an exercise to compare the competing applications across a matrix of
		usability and satisfaction. They were given time to familiarise themselves with the applications
		and then asked to plot each of the applications on the graph as seen below.</p>
		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="cs-image" src="images/usability-satisfaction matrix.png" alt="usability-satisfaction matrix" style="max-width:70%;">
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit"><i>• Shown here is the plotted mean for 5 sample users on a usability-satisfaction matrix. •</i></figcaption>	
		<p class="text">The interview also comprised of the users discussing their real/ hypothetic motivations to use the App, how they
		would go about the usage and what their pain points are. We looked at a page-wise critique of the application
		generally comprising of its homepage, category page and the final product page.</p>
		<p class="text">I also referred to user reviews from TuneIn's Facebook page and a forum called Anime Superhero which
		incidentally had a thread on TuneIn.</p>

		<h4 id="user-scenarios" class="heading-four">User Scenarios</h4>
		<p class="text">The user scenarios identified are informed by the 3 main types of user needs as discussed by Peter Morville and Louis Rosenfeld in their book, 
		<a class="inline-links" href="https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Information_Architecture_for_the_World_W.html?id=2d2Ry2hZc2MC&redir_esc=y">

		</ol>


		<h4 class="heading-four">Heuristic Walkthroughs with potential and existing users</h4>
		<p class="text">The types of user needs described above have been coalesced into 3 specific scenarios to undertake heuristic walkthroughs 
		in order to demonstrate specific user pain points.
		The tasks involved in achieving the goals shall be evaluated against the widely accepted 
		<a class="inline-links" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Jakob Nielson's heuristics.</a></p>				
		<p class="text">Once the violations to these heuristics are identified,

		<h3 class="heading-three">Making sense of it all aka Problem Definition</h3>



		<h4 class="heading-four">"Is this Live Radio?"</h4>
		<p class="text">The formative research on TuneIn exposed the tough competition that Radio faces from other
			types of content in video and written formats on the internet. Hence, introducing potential users like Maria
			to "Live Radio" and "Podcasts" also becomes an important function.  
		</p>
		<p class="text">For example, the homepage adorns the tagline below leading to a bad usability experience for "Exploratory seekers" 
			like Maria.</p>
		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="cs-image" src="screenshots/is this.png" alt="tagline" style="max-width:55%;">
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">• TuneIn's Tagline- "LIVE SPORTS. MUSIC. NEWS. PODCASTS." •</figcaption>
		<p class="text">Inspite of it's Unique Value Proposition being its vast catalog of Live and On-Demand Audio content, 
		the 'common-sounding' tagline fails to communicate TuneIn's m&eacute;tier.</p>



		<h4 class="heading-four-top">Information Architecture (IA)</h4>		
		<ul class="list-ia" type=none>
			<li class="list-item-ia"><h5 class="heading-five">1. Taxonomy</h5><p class="text">By shifting from its present system of organisation that appears to be a restrictive hierarchichal taxonomy, 
				TuneIn will benefit greatly to serve it's goal of enabling discovery by adopting a combination of Facet and 
				Hierarchichal Taxonomy.</p>

			<li class="list-item-ia"><h5 class="heading-five">2. Ontology</h5><p class="text">

				</figcaption>
			</li>
			<li class="list-item-ia"><h5 class="heading-five">3. Navigation</h5><p class="text">The current interface for 
				TuneIn has a strict hierarchical taxonomy under the four main categories of content- Music, Talk, Shows and 
				Sports. Hence, options for navigation are name-sake hierarchichal menus. However, user research indicates 
				users preferring modern modes of Discovery- from algorithms, curators, etc.
				Enabled by the restructured taxonomy, a recommender system learning from the set preferences and historical data of users
				shall facilitate a better navigation :</p>

				</ol>

		<h4 class="heading-four">Feature Prioritisation for the Redesign</h4>
		<p class="text">Feature prioritisation was estimated based on desirability and feasibility in terms of the technical overhaul.
		</p>
		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="cs-image" src="images/prioritisation.png" alt="feature prioritisation matrix" style="max-width:60%;">

		<h3 class="heading-three">Ideation, User Testing and Iteration</h3>
		<p class="text">The affordances to be incorporated into the structure and navigation were arrived at by
		iterating through user flows that follow the<a class="inline-links" href="#user-scenarios"> 3 Types of User Scenarios.</a>
		Feedback from 5 users and a product designer from cognitive walkthroughs with the help of 
		low-medium fidelity prototypes were used for user testing.</p>



		<h4 class="heading-four">Concept Sketches</h4>
		<p class="text">Hand-drawn user flows were used for early discussions with fellow designers. A separate Landing Page for TuneIn
		was ommited in the user flow as the user research was not in support of it. Instead, an onboarding flow was voted up 
		as an efficient way to ease into the application and populate the home page for a first time user.</p>
		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="cs-image" src="images/wireframe-sketch.png" alt="Wireframe sketches of the 4 user scenarios" style="max-width:55%;">
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">• User flows for the 3 types of User Scenarios •</figcaption>
		<p class="text">However, a concern was raised regarding the presence of certain sections in the Global navigation menus.
		A closed card sorting exercise was initiated. But the results of the Closed sort established the need for a 
		<a class="inline-links" href="https://xs6ofxgp.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/cpba263x">Hybrid card sort</a> due to 
		a reported "redundant and incomplete list of categories". Following is a Dendogram analysing the Hybrid Card Sorting Exercise.</p>
		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="cs-image" src="images/dendogram.png" alt="Card Sort Analysis" style="max-width:85%;">
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">• The dendogram shows 10 cards sorted into 3 distinct categories- HOME, LIBRARY AND FAVOURITES 
		instead of the initial HOME, DISCOVER and FAVOURITES. 
		Hence, the evidence to combine earlier 'Home' and 'Discover' categories into one for the purpose of discovery! •</figcaption>
				
		
		
		<h4 class="heading-four">Lo-Fi Wireframes</h4>
		<p class="text">Low fidelity wireframes have been used to make crucial UI decisions depending on
		user feedback.</p>
		<div class="full-width">
				<img class="cs-image" src="images/wireframe-1.png" alt="wirefarme-1" style="max-width:85%;">
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">• <b class="bold-miriam">HOMEPAGE:</b> The wireframe on the right moved forward with a few alterations. •</figcaption>
		<ol class="num-list" type="1">
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold-miriam">Utility Navigation : </b>TuneIn categorises it's contents into 4 types: Stations, Podcasts, Events and Shows.
			On analysing each type for its attributes and in an attempt to optimally modularise the UI, I decided to combine
			the Live content- 'Stations & Events' and the On-demand content- 'Podcasts & Shows' into 2 utility navigation options. 
			Usability tests revealed better exposure for the content as the time taken to browse reduced.</li>
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold-miriam">Carousel : </b>Dot navigation for the horizontal carousel was preferred.</li>
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold-miriam">Products per view : </b>Five stations/ podcasts per view under each category for each carousel seemed optimal.</li>
			<li class="list-item"><a class="inline-links" 
			href="https://uxplanet.org/design-a-perfect-search-box-b6baaf9599c"><b class="bold-miriam">Search bar : </b>Best practices</a> dictate that the search bar is to be

		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">• <b class="bold-miriam">PRODUCT PAGE:</b> Once again, the wireframe on the right moved forward with a ommissions. •</figcaption>
		<ol class="num-list" type="1">
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold-miriam">White Space : </b>White space is better managed at a macro scale to achieve good visual hierarchy for
			the option on the right.</li>
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold-miriam">Filter : </b>The option on the right incorporates a search bar within a podcast/show and the option to arrange the
			episodes in ascending or descending order. An icon with the drop-down menus make it more apparent and clickable.</li>
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold-miriam">Additional Features on hover : </b>Icons for 'share', 'like', 'comment' and playing an episode appear only on hovering over
			the episode as it emphasises the element in consideration.</li>
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold-miriam">Comments section : </b>Reviews or comments for product refinement tend to make sense. However, in this context, a 
			negative review would have no positive impact for TuneIn possibly even affecting its brand fidelity.
			Therefore, the 'like' option and 'number of streams' wherever relevant was chosen as an indicator of social acceptance.</li>
		</ol>
				

		<h3 class="heading-three">Churning out the design</h3>

		<h4 class="heading-four">High Fidelity Prototypes</h4>
		<p class="text">I used Figma to create the prototypes. The goal is to move towards a solution for all 9 of the features 
		identified during feature prioritisation.</p>

		<div class="title">EXPLORATORY SEEKING</div>
		<p class="text"><a class="inline-links" 
		href="https://www.figma.com/proto/SRxzMGtbafN8TIA38Ir35a/tune-in-FINAL?node-id=210%3A5337&viewport=350%2C304%2C0.018941471353173256&scaling=scale-down">
		The prototype demonstrating the user flow for exploratory seeking</a> serves Maria to access profile settings in order to update her 
		preferences. It also addresses the problem specifically mentioned in Scenario-2, Heuristic Walkthrough
		(Amy wants to listen to music by Amy Winehouse) delivering the search results with integrity.</p>

		<div class="title">RE-FINDING</div>
		<p class="text"><a class="inline-links" 
		href="https://www.figma.com/proto/SRxzMGtbafN8TIA38Ir35a/tune-in-FINAL?node-id=210%3A8894&viewport=627%2C382%2C0.10140478610992432&scaling=scale-down">
		The second prototype demonstrates re-finding</a> allowing Shyam to access a well organised favourited item. 
		The favourited item in consideration is notified to Shyam to have a new episode out. The feature to search for a 
		specific episode within a podcast and arrange the episodes in ascending or descending order is also incorporated.</p>
		
		<div class="title">KNOWN-ITEM SEEKING</div>
		<p class="text"><a class="inline-links" 
		href="https://www.figma.com/proto/SRxzMGtbafN8TIA38Ir35a/tune-in-FINAL?node-id=83%3A3714&viewport=85%2C343%2C0.06618700921535492&scaling=scale-down">
		The last prototype showcasing the user flow for known-item seeking</a> demonstrates Shyam signing up to TuneIn with an option to 
		indicate his preferences. The flow also shows Shyam searching for the station "Pravasi Bharathi" to add to his library to find later.</p>



		<h3 class="heading-three">Takeaways</h3>	
		<ol class="num-list" type="1">
			<li class="list-item-takeaway"><b class="bold-miriam">Live Radio under Threat :</b> Although news articles released on the likes of the "World Radio Day" may 
				argue otherwise, Radio as a medium is under threat and can only survive amongst the youth via the internet.
				Hence, studying the real-world context surrounding it gives us an insight into such
				applications' larger role. In this case, educating people about the jargon around radio, 
				identifying its utility for specific events such as local/ national disasters and 
				designing to incorporate such affordances can play a pivotal role in preserving it's relevance.
			</li>
			<li class="list-item-takeaway"><b class="bold-miriam">The Experience of Search and Discovery :</b> Although building algorithms is 
				rightfully the developer's role, designers informed and involved with 
				Search, Music Information Retrieval (IR) and Recommender Algorithms will prove a godsend to any team. According to my research, 
				features such as real-time content suggestions and weighted properties like 
				the occurence of an item being favourited, the number of streams, 
				the date and location seemed appropriate for retrieval. A combined content-based and collaborative filtering method 
				is the preffered choice of recommender system for its versatality.
			</li>
			<li class="list-item-takeaway"><b class="bold-miriam">At crossroads? Look to your user! :</b> I am swept away by the influence 
				user/ stakeholder interactions have towards design resolution each time. These contributions must never be overlooked. 
				That said, the opportunity to organise and conduct a successful Charrette would be a dream!
			</li>
