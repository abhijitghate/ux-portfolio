		<h2>Why Redesign TuneIn &#128251; ?</h2>

		<!-- <div class="full-width">
			<img class="cs-image" src="feature-matrix.png" alt="why redesign tunein?" style=width:100%;>
		</div> -->

		<p>Meet Maria! Maria finds herself getting distracted by video content, a major chunk of it on YouTube, 
		for hours at length.</p>

		<p>Maria is handed a Radio: Eureka!</p>
			
		<p>She realises that audio content happens to be consumable while being engaged- cooking, driving or even working! This 
		understanding initiates her resolution to be more productive and consume content in audio formats 
		henceforth. In her journey towards transitioning from consuming entertainment in the form of video 
		to audio, she lands herself on the <a href="https://tunein.com/">TuneIn website</a> more than a dozen times, 
		only to find herself never committing to its web browser application.</p>	
			
		<p>On a little investigation, she learns that TuneIn aims to be the largest (more than 100,000 radio stations 
		and 4 million podcasts) annotated catalog of live radio programming and on-demand radio from around the world with 
		more than 75 million monthly active users as of 2019. TuneIn works on multiple platforms like voice assistants, 
		home sound systems, multiroom entertainment platforms, Google Play Store, App Store, Microsoft Store, is even
		integrated with various car models, etc.</p>
			
		<p>Despite TuneIn's extensive database of diverse content, Maria identifies it to be unknown to most people around her.
		She also identifies it's web browser application to be among its most apathetic yet accessible interfaces. And so begins 
		the journey of this redesign of its web browser application.</p>

		<p>Since I was looking to do a redesign piece for my portfolio, it lands on me to try redesigning TuneIn 
		to be more empathetic to its users.</p>

		<h2>UX Roadmap</h2>

		<p>In order to identify the pain points and subsequent opportunities for redesign, an
		iterative design process that comprised of the following UX activities
		were carried out within a self-imposed period of a month.</p>
		
		<h3>Research</h3>
		<h4>Competitive audit</h4>

		<p>TuneIn's business goal is steered to promote streaming live radio on the internet
		and bringing all of radio from world over on one dial and further solving for discovery.</p>
			
		<p>Music streaming websites are also being considered competitors to TuneIn since music
		streaming and the new "radio" that are automated playlists are impacting the market share for
		Live Radio making it all the more crucial to observe and analyse those services as well.</p>

		<p>Popular competitors to TuneIn as listed by web analytics service,<a href="https://www.similarweb.com/">
		SimilarWeb</a> and as per <a href="https://xconomy.com/national/2013/01/11/turning-on-to-live-internet-radio-with-tunein/?single_page=true">
		an interview of the current CEO of TuneIn, John Dunham by Wade Roush, a podcast producer</a>
		are iHeartRadio, Sirius XM, Pandora, Deezer (which are not available in India) and <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/">Stitcher</a>,
		<a href="https://www.spotify.com/in/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> 
		and <a href="https://radio.garden/listen/therunnner-radio/SDoYxqkH">Radio Garden</a> among others.</p>

		<p>Out of these, the applications chosen for the audit were based on:
			<ol type="1">
				<li>Whether or not they aim to cater to a global user base</li>
				<li>Similarity of the products they offered to TuneIn</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<div class="full-width">
      		<img class="cs-image" src="feature-matrix.png" alt="feature matrix" style="width:1200px;">
		</div>

		<h4>User Research</h4>

		<p>The user base that I convened comprised of:
			<ol type="1">
				<li>Maria</li>
				<li>Friends who use/are familiar with TuneIn or it's competitor applications.</li>
				<li>Traditional radio users who were open to the idea of engaging with a radio application on a PC.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<p>Five individuals from the aforementioned user base participated
		in an exercise to compare the competing applications across a matrix of
		usability and satisfaction. They were given time to familiarise themselves with the applications
		and then asked to plot each of the applications on the graph as seen below.</p>

		<div class="full-width">
			<img src="" alt="usability-satisfaction matrix" style="max-width:100%; height: 42px; border: 0;">
		</div>	
		<p><i>Shown here is the plotted mean for the 5 users.</i></p>

		<p>Although Spotify is higher up in its overall performance mainly attributed
		to its "recommender system" and its aesthetics, users claim it isn't the most efficient
		of applications owing to it's incoherent sections under the Browse panel. Stitcher is at par in
		it's usability due to its "Less is more" approach in content organisation. Radio Garden with
		it's unique and minimalistic approach to presenting Live Radio remains highly usable lagging behind
		in its aesthetic element. The most outstanding thing about SoundCloud is the importance
		the application gives to user engagement via its socialisation features. iHeart Radio which is the
		closest in function to TuneIn scores well in it's overall performance as it makes a large
		amount of unique content convenient for discovery and is ahead of TuneIn in terms of usability and engagement.</p>

			<p>Further interviews comprised of the users discussing their real/ hypothetic motivations to use the App, how they
				would go about the usage and what their pain points are. We looked at a page-wise critique of the application
				generally comprising of its homepage, category page and the final product page.</p>

			<p>I also referred to user reviews from TuneIn's Facebook page and a forum called Anime Superhero which
				incidentally had a thread on TuneIn.</p>

			<p>The pain points as pointed out by the users verbatim:</p>

			 <h4>Unveiling of our User Personas</h4>

			 	<img src="" alt="personas" style="width: 42px; height: 42px; border: 0;">

			<h4>Heuristic Walkthroughs with potential and existing users</h4>

				<p>Since we are focusing only on the redesign of its web browser application,
				we shall restrict hypothesising Maria and Shyam engaging with it to indoors
				i.e., at home, at a work/ co-working place or in certain public spaces as
				informed by the user research. The personas and research enabled
				identification of various goals that a user may want to achieve.
				The tasks involved in achieving the goals shall be evaluated against
				one among the widely accepted set of heuristics.</p>

				<p>Jakob Nielson's heuristics:</p>
				<ol type="1">
					<li>Visibility of system status</li>
					<li>Match between system and the real world</li>
					<li>User control and freedom</li>
					<li>Consistency and standards</li>
					<li>Error prevention</li>
					<li>Recognition rather than recall</li>
					<li>Flexibility and efficiency of use</li>
					<li>Aesthetic and minimalist design</li>
					<li>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</li>
					<li>Help and documentation</li>
				</ol>

				<p>Once the violations to these heuristics are identified,
					they will be given a severity rating.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>0 — don’t agree that this is a usability problem</li>
					<li>1 — cosmetic problem</li>
					<li>2 — minor usability problem</li>
					<li>3 — major usability problem; important to fix</li>
					<li>4 — usability catastrophe; imperative to fix</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Making sense of it all a.k.a. Problem Definition</h3>

				<h4>Information Architecture</h4>

				<p>This round of formative research helps in identification of
					complications primarily in Navigation, Search and Discovery.</p>

				<h4>Taxonomy and Semantics</h4>

			<h4>card Sort</h4>
				<p>The taxonomy is aligned with its business goals, hence credible.
				However, certain flows do indicate missing/ erroneous tags which
				will need to be flagged and raised with the data collection and
				developer teams if this were a real-time project.</p>

				<p>Global Semantics used on the page work well. However,
				semantics used on regional categories are not on par and
				carry the scope of another project utilising extensive regional
				resources in itself.</p>

				<h4>*“Is this live radio?”*: Redesigning Navigation, Search and Discovery</h4>

				<p>The Key Insights derived from potential users indicated ineffective
				communication of a unique value proposition for users in the Homepage.
				The Navigation menus also contributed to confusion in the spectrum of
				products offered by the application.</p>
				<p>As a result, there is a requirement to clarify that the 2 types of products
				 offered are Live Radio and On-Demand Radio (otherwise known as Podcasts)
				 and support that with a USP in the Info page during on-boarding.</p>

				<p>For the sake of Search and Discovery however, the products have been
				divided into 4 categories based on their attributes:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Live Radio: Name, Production, Currently playing</li>
					<li>Podcasts: Name, Production</li>
					<li>Events: Name, Description, Station, Date, Timing</li>
					<li>Shows: Name, Station</li>
			</ol>

				<p>Each kind of product offered is further categorised based on various
					user-friendly categories and also the genre of content.</p>

				<p>The overall scope of this redesign is thus mostly confined to the features
					that come under the gamut of Navigation, Search and Discovery.</p>

				<h4>Feature Prioritisation</h4>

				<p>What this activity attempts to do is prioritise features based on
					desirability and feasibility in terms of technical overhaul and time
					or viability in terms of business goals.</p>

				<img src="" alt="feature prioritisation matrix" style="width: 42px; height: 42px; border: 0;">

				<h3>Churning out the design</h3>

				<h4>User Scenarios</h4>

				<p>User scenarios have been designed to incorporate
					exploratory and explicatory user-flows of a first-time user to
					share the on-boarding flow and that of a seasoned user going about
					advanced functionalities respectively to capture the span of possible
					scenarios.</p>

				<p>1. Maria who has been looking for new ways to entertain herself is
					 recommended to listen to Podcasts on TuneIn by a friend.(socail media aspect)</p>
